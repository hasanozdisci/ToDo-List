#### About Project:
-  An empty character cannot be added to the list. However, it also gives the same error when nothing is written.
- There are functions in the JavaScript code that make it possible to add elements to the list, delete and mark them
- It gives an alert in the upper right corner of the screen when an element is added and gives an error
